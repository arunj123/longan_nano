DMA0's channels and their mappings:

The **DMA0 controller has 7 channels**, ranging from Channel 0 to Channel 6. The DMA controller prioritises requests based on software and hardware rules, with **DMA Channel 0 holding the highest hardware priority and DMA Channel 6 having the lowest**. It is important to note that **several requests from different peripherals may be mapped to a single DMA channel**, and these are logically ORed before reaching the DMA controller. Therefore, the **user must ensure that only one request is enabled at a time on one channel** to prevent conflicts. DMA transfers can occur from peripheral to memory, memory to peripheral, or memory to memory.

Here are the specific mappings for each DMA0 channel:

*   **DMA0 Channel 0**: **ADC0**, TIMER1_CH2, TIMER3_CH0.
*   **DMA0 Channel 1**: **SPI0_RX**, USART2_TX, TIMER0_CH0, TIMER1_UP, TIMER2_CH2.
*   **DMA0 Channel 2**: **SPI0_TX**, USART2_RX, **USART0_TX**, TIMER0_CH1, TIMER2_CH3, TIMER2_UP. (As previously discussed, **SPI0_TX and USART0_TX share this channel**, meaning only one should be enabled at a time).
*   **DMA0 Channel 3**: **SPI1/I2S1_RX**, **USART0_RX**, I2C1_TX, TIMER0_CH3, TIMER0_TG, TIMER0_CMT, TIMER3_CH1. (As previously discussed, **SPI1/I2S1_RX and USART0_RX share this channel**, meaning only one should be enabled at a time).
*   **DMA0 Channel 4**: **SPI1/I2S1_TX**, I2C1_RX, TIMER0_UP, TIMER1_CH0, TIMER3_CH2.
*   **DMA0 Channel 5**: USART1_RX, I2C0_TX, TIMER0_CH2, TIMER2_CH0, TIMER2_TG.
*   **DMA0 Channel 6**: USART1_TX, I2C0_RX, TIMER1_CH1, TIMER1_CH3, TIMER3_UP.

The **DMA1 controller has 5 channels** (from Channel 0 to Channel 4). The DMA controller prioritises requests, with DMA Channel 0 (of DMA0) having the highest hardware priority and DMA Channel 6 (of DMA0) having the lowest. Similar to DMA0, **several requests from different peripherals may be mapped to a single DMA channel** and are logically ORed before entering the DMA. It is crucial for the user's software to **ensure that only one request is enabled at a time on any given channel** to prevent conflicts.

Here are the specific mappings for each DMA1 channel:

*   **DMA1 Channel 0**: SPI2/I2S2_RX, TIMER4_CH3, TIMER4_TG.
*   **DMA1 Channel 1**: SPI2/I2S2_TX, TIMER4_CH2, TIMER4_UP.
*   **DMA1 Channel 2**: UART3_RX, TIMER5_UP, DAC_CH0.
*   **DMA1 Channel 3**: TIMER4_CH1, TIMER6_UP, DAC_CH1.
*   **DMA1 Channel 4**: UART3_TX, TIMER4_CH0.

These mappings are explicitly detailed in Table 9-4 "DMA1 requests for each channel" and Figure 9-5 "DMA1 request mapping".

From Table 9-4 "DMA1 requests for each channel" and Figure 9-5 "DMA1 request mapping", the DMA1 channels are assigned to SPI2/I2S2, UART3, DAC, and various TIMER4, TIMER5, and TIMER6 requests, but not to SPI0, USART0, or SPI1/I2S1.

For reference, , **SPI0, UART0 (USART0), and SPI1 (SPI1/I2S1) utilise DMA0 channels**:
*   **USART0_TX**: DMA0 Channel 2
*   **USART0_RX**: DMA0 Channel 3
*   **SPI0_RX**: DMA0 Channel 1
*   **SPI0_TX**: DMA0 Channel 2
*   **SPI1/I2S1_RX**: DMA0 Channel 3
*   **SPI1/I2S1_TX**: DMA0 Channel 4

There are indeed **conflicting DMA channels** for USART0 (UART0), SPI0, and SPI1.

Here are the specific conflicts:

*   **DMA0 Channel 2** is used by both **SPI0_TX** (transmit) requests and **USART0_TX** (transmit) requests.
*   **DMA0 Channel 3** is used by both **SPI1/I2S1_RX** (receive) requests and **USART0_RX** (receive) requests.

The user manual explicitly addresses this scenario. It states that "Several requests from peripherals may be mapped to one DMA channel. They are logically ORed before entering the DMA".

**The crucial instruction for managing these conflicts is that the user "has to ensure that only one request is enabled at a time on one channel"**.

This means that while the hardware allows multiple peripheral DMA requests to be routed to the same channel, it is the responsibility of your software to ensure that you only enable the DMA request for *one* of these peripherals on that specific channel at any given time to avoid contention and unexpected behaviour.
